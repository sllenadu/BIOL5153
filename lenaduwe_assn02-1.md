Research interests; host-pathogen dynamics, inflammation and immune
responses, genomics and transcriptomics, experimental design and
statistical analysis, mechanisms of pathogenesis, biofilm formation.

#### Education

**University of Arkansas (2019-present)**

  - Masterâ€™s student in Cell and Molecular Biology

Research involves understanding the host-pathogen interaction between
Staphylococcus agnetis and chicken macrophage like cell line (HTC
cells). This includes studying the molecular underpinnings that leads to
bacterial survival and escape from macrophages.

#### Work experience

Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (2017-2019)**

  - Coordinating lectures for Medical Laboratory Science undergraduates
    in English medium.

  - Organizing laboratory based practical for all courses.

  - Conducting tutorials and lecture discussions for multiple modules
    including microbiology, clinical biochemistry, hematology and
    immunology.

  - Visiting lecturer, BSc Biomedical Sciences, Management and Science
    University (MSU) (2018)
    
      - Clinical Biochemistry.

  - Tutor, Cambridge International Examinations Ordinary Level, Anphaema
    Institute, Wattala (2015-2017)
